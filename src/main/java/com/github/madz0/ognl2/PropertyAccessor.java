/**
 * This interface defines methods for setting and getting a property from a target object. A
 * "property" in this case is a named data value that takes the generic form of an Object---the same
 * definition as is used by beans. But the operational semantics of the term will vary by
 * implementation of this interface: a bean-style implementation will get and set properties as
 * beans do, by reflection on the target object's class, but other implementations are possible,
 * such as one that uses the property name as a key into a map.
 * <p>
 * An implementation of this interface will often require that its target objects all be of some
 * particular type. For example, the MapPropertyAccessor class requires that its targets all
 * implement the java.util.Map interface.
 * <p>
 * Note that the "name" of a property is represented by a generic Object. Some implementations may
 * require properties' names to be Strings, while others may allow them to be other types---for
 * example, ArrayPropertyAccessor treats Number names as indexes into the target object, which must
 * be an array.
